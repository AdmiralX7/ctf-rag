**RAG-Augmented Answer:**

Based on the context provided, here are the four transformations and the order in which they were reversed:

The four distinct mathematical transformations applied to the input were:
1.  Linear Congruential Transformation (to generate a key)
2.  Bitwise XOR Operation
3.  Modular Exponentiation
4.  Modular Matrix Multiplication

To find the flag, these operations were reversed in the opposite order:
1.  **Reverse Modular Matrix Multiplication**
2.  **Reverse Modular Exponentiation**
3.  **Reverse Bitwise XOR Operation**

**Standard LLM Answer (No RAG):**

Excellent question about a classic Minecraft CTF challenge. The "McFlagChecker" challenge required players to reverse-engineer a series of mathematical operations performed by the datapack's command blocks.

Here are the four distinct mathematical transformations and the order in which they were reversed.

### The Four Forward Transformations

The datapack took the player's input score, which represented the ASCII value of a single character in the flag, and applied the following four operations in order. Let's call the initial score `S`.

1.  **Modulo 256:** The score was first taken modulo 256. This operation ensures the input is within the standard 8-bit ASCII range. Since the input was expected to be an ASCII character code (0-255), this step effectively did nothing, but it was an important part of the logic.
    *   `S_1 = S % 256`

2.  **Multiplication by 1337:** The result was then multiplied by the constant `1337`.
    *   `S_2 = S_1 * 1337`

3.  **Modulo 65536:** The new, larger number was taken modulo `65536` (which is 2ยนโถ). This keeps the score within the range of a 16-bit integer.
    *   `S_3 = S_2 % 65536`

4.  **Addition of 42069:** Finally, the constant `42069` was added to the score.
    *   `S_4 = S_3 + 42069`

The datapack would then compare this final score, `S_4`, against a specific target value. If they matched, that character of the flag was correct.

### The Reversal Process to Find the Flag

To find the original input score (`S`), you must reverse these transformations, starting with the final target score and working backward.

1.  **Reverse the Addition:** The last operation was adding `42069`. The inverse is subtraction. You start with the known target score for a specific character and subtract `42069`.
    *   `S_3 = Target Score - 42069`

2.  **Reverse the Modulo & Multiplication (The Crucial Step):** This is the most complex step. We know that `S_3 = (S_1 * 1337) % 65536`. Reversing this is not a simple division. It means that `S_1 * 1337` must be a number that, when divided by `65536`, leaves a remainder of `S_3`. Mathematically:
    *   `S_1 * 1337 = S_3 + (k * 65536)` for some non-negative integer `k`.

    To solve for `S_1`, you must find an integer `k` such that `S_3 + (k * 65536)` is perfectly divisible by `1337`, and the result is a valid ASCII value (between 0 and 255). One would typically write a small script to loop through values of `k` (0, 1, 2, ...) until a valid solution is found.

    *   `S_1 = (S_3 + k * 65536) / 1337`

3.  **Reverse the Modulo 256:** The first operation was `S_1 = S % 256`. However, because we are looking for an ASCII character, we already know the original score `S` must be in the range of 0-255. Therefore, `S % 256` is equal to `S`. This means the value `S_1` you found in the previous step *is* the original ASCII code. No reversal is necessary for this step.

### Summary Table

| Step | Forward Transformation (Input `S`) | Reverse Transformation (Start with `Target`) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | `S_1 = S % 256` | **(No action needed)** Result from next step is the answer. |
| **2** | `S_2 = S_1 * 1337` | **Solve `S_1 = (S_3 + k*65536) / 1337` for `k`** |
| **3** | `S_3 = S_2 % 65536` | (Combined with reversing step 2) |
| **4** | `S_4 = S_3 + 42069` | **`S_3 = Target - 42069`** |

In short, to find each character of the flag, you would take its corresponding target value, subtract `42069`, and then solve the modular arithmetic equation to find the single valid ASCII code that could produce that result.
